yarn init
yarn add nodemon -D


justification -> this is how git workflow goes ->
git checkout integration
git checkout -b hello
git add .
git commit -m "stupidname"
git push -u origin
this takes time in a project,
what if we could just get rid of that
this is how git looks after a project

the fastest point between two objects is a straight line
we edit in the cloud and just pull everytime we want the most recent version of our branch
other branches are
i can see the project grow live in my branch, files get added, removed
every single file creation or edited line gets saved, when you hover you can see who edited the last file


It can be used to take live notes as a group for example

Stretches connect to files stored locally on your editor?
